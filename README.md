Blackjack code works except for splits which I haven't tested for now. Currently working in building an AI model that I can train to play blackjack and will commit when finished.

Blackjack was programmed with the help of ChatGPT to speed up programming. Any weird code is problably the result of this code being modified to work with my code.
